# Hello-World
My first Repository

I am a 34 year old Male with a degree in Computer Information Systems. I haven't really ever used my degree. I'm currently the head estimator at a landscape company that I run with my father. He's looking to retire in the next 5 years and I want to do something new. I'm hoping to get into data analysis so I can both use my degree and get a new job.
